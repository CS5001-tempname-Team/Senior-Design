### Project Goal: Bridge the Gap between Natural Langauges and Formal Specifications

### D0
 * This diagram is a very topical, high-level overview of what we want to acheive.
### D1
  * This diagram shows the 2 major aspects of the "bridge" to have this implementation. We need to parse our natural language and then select what we think is important so it may be converted into logic formats which can be understood by a computer.
  
 ### D2
  * This diagram breaks down to the most root aspects of the NLP process. As of right know we are looking deeper into the subject. However lack of background and it being a new subject as lead to a few holes in how to "bridge the gap", however we know that this diagram does translate correctly in our research and from our advisor.
