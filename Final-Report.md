Our research project goal was to be able to bridge the gap between natural language and formal requirements by using both manual labor, automated tools, as well as our own deliverables. This capstone project aimed to develop an automated approach to formulate formal specifications from natural language requirements, such as regulation and policy documentation. To achieve this goal, a research paper on the extraction of requirements specification from natural language is being utilized. This paper will serve as the main reference while working toward a solution. Requirements will be analyzed in various policy documents and linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas will be derived from these requirements. Ambiguity is often observed in technical specifications because they are written in a natural language (e.g. English). These formulas will allow for the elimination of this ambiguity.

## User Stories and Design Diagrams

### User Stories
_See [this link](https://github.com/NLP-with-GKS/Senior-Design/blob/master/Classwork-Homework/User_Stories.md) to go to the file_

- User Story #1:
As an engineer, I want to implement a way to transform natural language requirements into formal language. This will be achieved with an automated solution that allows me to see linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas of my natural language processor at the press of a button. I will be able to view requirements in predicate form, which eliminates ambiguity.

- User Story #2:
As an academic, I want to transform my natural language requirements into a formal language so that I can bridge the gap between my requirements and formal methods.

- User Story #3:
As a user, I want to know if there is a better way for my requirements to be integrated into my project so that I can get my product to market faster.

## Budget

* In this project, we have spent no money.  We had no reason to spend any money on the project as it was research based and centered around open-source software.
