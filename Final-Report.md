## Project Description

Our research project goal was to be able to bridge the gap between natural language and formal requirements by using both manual labor, automated tools, as well as our own deliverables. This capstone project aimed to develop an automated approach to formulate formal specifications from natural language requirements, such as regulation and policy documentation. To achieve this goal, a research paper on the extraction of requirements specification from natural language is being utilized. This paper will serve as the main reference while working toward a solution. Requirements will be analyzed in various policy documents and linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas will be derived from these requirements. Ambiguity is often observed in technical specifications because they are written in a natural language (e.g. English). These formulas will allow for the elimination of this ambiguity.

## User Interface Specification
As this was a research project, there was no need to design a user interface. The deliverables were data-driven.

## Test Plan and Results
The test plan and results of our tests can be accessed from [this link](https://github.com/NLP-with-GKS/Senior-Design/blob/master/Test_Plan_and_Results.pdf)
